# ShipManagementSystem

This application was generated for the SA Launch DEMO by the Avengers Team.

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. Java >= 8
2. Node.js

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    npm start

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the ShipManagementSystem application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean verify

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.jar

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw verify

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```

To start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
